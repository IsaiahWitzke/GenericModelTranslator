# GenericModelTranslator
For co-op work report

A POC to help translate code from one programing language to another. The user of the script defines the syntax and document form of the language you are translating to/from. The user can also define some "smart" functions in python that will be used in translation.

This set of scripts are actually helpful if you want to translate a large (but somewhat simple) file (Some examples include large SQL schema -> express api CRUD endpoint code, Java-SpringBoot Entity class -> TypeScript interface). Theoretically, you could translate any language into any other language...
